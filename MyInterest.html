                        I Love DJ Mixing. Usually i does it for fun and releasing<br>
                        my stress away. I've learned DJ Mixing when i was 17 Years<br>
                        old, at Courses and Youtube Tutorial. I can't say that I'm<br>
                        a pro at DJ Mixing, but i think im good enough.<br>
                        Rarely people knew this, but not every DJ is working through<br>
                        a night world, such as nightclub, etc. There are some of us who<br>
                        works only for uploading a mixtape, DJ at someone's BDay party, etc.</h1>

                        Youtube is a part of my Life right now. I've started Youtube<br>
                        as a hobby, and now i made some money out of it aswell. Youtube<br>
                        has a lots of impact for my life. Back in the day i hardly<br>
                        talk to others, but now im able to entertain people around<br>
                        the world. Well i've seen youtubers/Content Creator right now<br>
                        that they make videos only for money. They aren't really care<br>
                        about their content. My opinion for you guys who does that stuff<br>
                        i think you need to stop doing youtube. It won't work well if you<br>
                        didn't enjoy making content. Youtube also has guidelines for<br>
                        Youtubers before they can earn some money from Google Adsense.<br>
                        You need at least 10,000 views total, 3,000 minutes of Watch Time<br>
                        on your channel first, before that you aren't able to earn money<br>
                        through youtube.

                        means i love Playing Games aswell. Right now i can't really<br>
                        play games as much as before, because i have more important<br>
                        and productive to do first.</h1>
